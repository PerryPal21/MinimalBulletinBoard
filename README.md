*Try saying this three times fast*

MBB is lightweight and minimal bulletin board made in EJS tailored for easy self hosting. I was inspired by the idea of old [Bulletin Board Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) and wanted to make a clean and minimal rendition of the concept myself.

## Features
- A login and registration system
- View of users who signed up
- Renaming of image files to see who posted what
- Nice and clean message showcase
- very easy to selfhost thanks to Nodejs and NPM

## Coming Soon
- An easy way to delete posts
